####NuPack Markup Calculator

NuPack takes existing products and repackages them for sale at electronic stores like Best Buy. The NuPack Markup Calculator estimates the cost of a NuPack job after markups.

A flat markup of 5% is applied to every job, after which the following markups are calculated:

+ 1.2% for every person who needs to work on the job
+ 7.5% if the product category is 'pharmaceuticals'
+ 13% if the product category is 'food'
+ 2.5% if the product category is 'electronics'
